HackerNews Best Stories API 
This is a simple ASP.NET Core Web API that retrieves the details of the first n "best stories" from the Hacker News API.
The API uses caching to efficiently handle large numbers of requests without risking overloading the HackerNews API. 
**How to Run the Application**:
1.Clone this repository to your local machine.
2.Open the solution in Visual Studio 2022.
3.Build the project to resolve dependencies.
4.Press the "Start" button in Visual Studio to run the API locally.
5.The API should be accessible at https://localhost:<port>/api/BestStories/{n}, where {n} is the number of best stories we want to retrieve. 
**Endpoints**: 
GET /api/BestStories/{n} - Retrieves the first n "best stories" from the HackerNews API sorted by their score in descending order. 
**Assumptions**: 
1.The development server uses a self-signed SSL certificate, which may cause SSL-related warnings in web browsers.
2.The API uses an in-memory cache (provided by MemoryCache) to store the fetched best stories. The cache is set to expire after 5 minutes. 
**Enhancements and Changes**: 
Given more time, some potential enhancements and changes that could be made to the application are: 
1.Implement proper error handling and error responses to provide better feedback to clients. 
2.Add unit tests to verify the functionality of the API and ensure robustness. 
3.Implement API versioning to allow for future backward compatibility with breaking changes.
4.Add logging to track API usage and identify potential issues. 
5.Add authentication and authorization to secure the API if necessary.
6.Implement paging support to allow clients to fetch stories in batches.
